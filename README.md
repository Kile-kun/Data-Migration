## Project Case Study: Data Migration Project for an SME

### Background:
An SME in the retail industry was planning to upgrade their existing Data Architecture to modern and more scalable technology. The upgrade required the migration of data from the old systems to the new ones. The project involved migrating large volumes of customer and transaction data while ensuring that data quality was maintained and business operations were not disrupted.

### Objectives:
The primary objective of the data migration project was to ensure a smooth transition from the old systems to the new ones without any loss of data or disruption to business operations. The project also aimed to improve data quality, optimize the new systems' performance, and reduce storage costs.
